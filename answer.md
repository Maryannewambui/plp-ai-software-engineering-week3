1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
# Answer:
TensorFlow is used to build and train deep learning models as it facilitates the creation of computational graphs and efficient execution on various hardware platforms.
  # Features: 
  - Models can be developed easily: supports high-level APIs, through which Machine Learning models can be built easily using Neural Networks.
  - Complex Numeric Computations can be done: As the input dataset is huge, the mathematical computations/calculations can be done easily.
  - Consists of Machine Learning APIs: TensorFlow is rich in Machine Learning APIs that are of both low-level and high-level. Stable APIs are available in different languages
  - Easy deployment and computation using CPU, GPU: TensorFlow supports training and building models on CPU and GPU. 
  - Contains pre-trained models and datasets: Google has included many datasets and pre-trained models in TensorFlow.

2. What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?
# Answer:
PyTorch employs dynamic computational graphs while TensorFlow employs static computational graphs

3. What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?
# Answer:
Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks.
It uses these frameworks: 
  - TensorFlow (mostly)
  - PyTorch
  - MXNet

4. What are the key features of Scikit-learn?
# Answer:
 - Supervised Learning algorithms

 - Unsupervised Learning algorithms − it also has all the popular unsupervised learning algorithms from clustering, factor analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to unsupervised neural networks.

 - Clustering − This model is used for grouping unlabeled data.

 - Cross Validation − It is used to check the accuracy of supervised models on unseen data.

 - Dimensionality Reduction − It is used for reducing the number of attributes in data which can be further used for summarisation, visualisation and feature selection.

 - Ensemble methods − As name suggest, it is used for combining the predictions of multiple supervised models.

 - Feature extraction − It is used to extract the features from data to define the attributes in image and text data.

 - Open Source − It is open source library and also commercially usable under BSD licens

6. In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?
# Answer:
 The Dropout layer in TensorFlow is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in neural networks

7. What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?
# Answer:
 - in optimizer is a specific implementation of the optimization algorithm that is used to update the parameters of a neural network. e.g. Adam is one of the most commonly used optimizers due to its adaptive learning rate and momentum properties.


8. In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?
# Answer:
 - Keras Conv2D is a 2D Convolution Layer, this layer creates a convolution kernel that is wind with layers input which helps produce a tensor of outputs.

9. What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?
# Answer:
 - The Scikit-learn example uses a Naïve Bayes classifier, specifically the Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB) model. 
 - The dataset applied: 20 Newsgroups


10. What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?
# Answer:
 - there isnt any example of jupyter notbook
