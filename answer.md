1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
# Answer:
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework. Its used for building and training deep learning models.
# Features
- Flexibility: Supports both high-level and low-level APIs.
- Scalability: Can run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
- Comprehensive Ecosystem: Includes TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js, and TensorFlow Extended (TFX).

2. What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?
# Answer:
TensorFlow is a framework used for building and training deep learning models while PyTorch is  an open-source machine learning library known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use.

3. What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?
# Answer:
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.

4. What are the key features of Scikit-learn?
# Answer:
- Wide Range of Algorithms: Includes classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
- Ease of Use: Consistent API and extensive documentation.
- Integration with Other Libraries: Works well with NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

5. What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?
# Answer:
Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

# features:
- Interactive Environment: Run code in an interactive manner.
- Support for Multiple Languages: Primarily used for Python, but supports other languages like R and Julia.
- Rich Output: Display visualizations, tables, and other rich media.


6. In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?
# Answer:
purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network is to reduce the likelihood of overfitting which occurs when the model performs well on training data but struggles to generalize to unseen test data.


7. What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?
# Answer:
optimizer updates the models parameters to mininize loss function



8. In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?
# Answer:
 Conv2D layer extracts features from the input images.

9. What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?
# Answer:
model: Random Forest Classifier
dataset: Iris dataset


10. What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?
# Answer:
The Jupyter Notebook example generates a line plot of a sine wave. The x-axis represents the range of values (x), and the y-axis shows the corresponding sine values (sin(x)). It is labeled as "Sine Wave," with the x-axis labeled as "x" and the y-axis labeled as "sin(x)."
